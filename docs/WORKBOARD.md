# Work board

One page, two lanes. Read this before picking work, write here before building. This file
holds who is doing what right now; `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md` holds what happened. The split
protocol itself lives near the top of that file ("Two subscriptions, one repo").

How it works:

- Anthony drops feedback in either chat, tablet or desktop. Whichever Claude receives it
  writes each item into the Inbox below, splits anything big into workable pieces, and
  pushes this file immediately so the other lane sees it.
- A lane claims an item by moving it under its own heading with the date. Claim and push
  BEFORE building, so the other lane sees the claim before any code exists.
- Finished items move to Done with the round number, and the round writes its change log
  entry in `docs/PROJECT-STATE.md` as always.
- The 3 hourly scheduled cloud sessions count as the cloud lane and respect claims here
  exactly like a live session.
- An item claimed more than 4 days ago with no round landed goes back to the Inbox, so a
  dead session cannot squat on work.

## Inbox (unclaimed)

- Encyclopedia mining (tweaks item 12, the permanent backlog, pages 4 to 51 of his
  document): either lane pulls a system from it when its own list runs dry. Mine it for
  mechanics, never its vocabulary (simNoRivalNames enforces this).

## Desktop lane (Claude Code on Anthony's PC)

Claimed 2026-08-28. This lane takes the work that needs what only this machine has: the
Supabase MCP, the Lovable MCP, and cheap long local browser runs.

- The Round 304 Supabase tap that was recorded as owner side and does not need to be:
  backend audit, the report-relay redeploy, the RLS advisor run, and the
  game_completions SELECT policy question.
- The Club Manager half of tweaks item 10 (more leagues, more eras), which Round 302
  queued behind Supabase access: the data pulls happen from this lane.
- Tweaks item 9: the full playGames browser run over every game, every feature, then fix
  every finding.
- Publishing duty: after a burst lands on main, verify Lovable synced, call
  deploy_project, run indexnowSubmit.

## Cloud lane (tablet sessions and the 3 hourly scheduled sessions)

Claimed 2026-08-28:

- Manager arc four: promotion style world editing, the last piece of tweaks item 11.
- The react-router v7 breaking major that Round 304 queued as its own round.
- New game rounds and record shelf tables, the self contained work.

## Done

(move items here with the round number that shipped them)
